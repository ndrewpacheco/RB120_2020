# Create a class called MyCar.
# When you initialize a new instance or object of the class,
# allow the user to define some instance variables that tell us the year, color, and model
#of the car.
# Create an instance variable that is set to 0 during instantiation of the object to
# track the current speed of the car as well.
# Create instance methods that allow the car to speed up, brake, and shut the car off.
